"""
PetCircle — Unified Storage Service (GCP + Supabase)

Provides a single abstraction over document file storage. GCP Cloud Storage
is the primary backend; Supabase is the silent fallback if GCP is unavailable
or misconfigured.

Design rules:
    - GCP is tried first on every upload. Any exception → fallback to Supabase.
    - No exception is ever raised from upload_file unless BOTH backends fail.
    - GCP client is initialized once and cached. Missing credentials are treated
      as "GCP unavailable" — the app starts cleanly without them.
    - Downloads route to the backend recorded in documents.storage_backend.
      If the recorded backend fails, the other is tried as an emergency fallback.
    - All GCP SDK calls run in asyncio.run_in_executor() to avoid blocking
      the event loop (same pattern as existing Supabase calls).

Scope:
    - This service handles DOCUMENTS only (documents table).
    - Pet photos (pets.photo_path) continue using upload_to_supabase directly
      in onboarding services — they are out of scope for GCP migration.
