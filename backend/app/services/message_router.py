"""
PetCircle Phase 1 — Message Router

Routes incoming WhatsApp messages to the appropriate service handler
based on message type, user state, and conversation context.

Routing logic:
    1. New user (no DB record) → Create pending user, start onboarding
    2. User in onboarding (state != 'complete') → Continue onboarding
    3. Button payload (reminder) → Reminder response handler
    4. Button payload (conflict) → Conflict resolution handler
    5. Image/Document → Document upload + GPT extraction pipeline
    6. Text "add pet" → Start new pet onboarding
    7. Text "dashboard" → Send dashboard links
    8. Text → Query engine (pet health questions)

Rules:
    - No business logic in this file — only routing decisions.
    - Errors are caught and friendly messages sent back.
    - Never crashes on individual message failures.
