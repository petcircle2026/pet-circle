PetCircle Phase 1 — WhatsApp Webhook Router (Module 4)

Route: /webhook/whatsapp

Handles incoming WhatsApp events from Meta's Cloud API.
This layer does ONLY:
    1. Signature verification (GET: token match, POST: HMAC-SHA256)
    2. Payload parsing (robust nested dictionary extraction)
    3. Message type detection (text, image, document, button)
    4. Logging ALL incoming payloads to message_logs
    5. Passing structured objects to the service layer

NO business logic lives here. No onboarding, no preventive logic,
no GPT calls. Just parsing, validation, and forwarding.

    """
    Extract message details from Meta's deeply nested webhook payload.

    Meta's WhatsApp Cloud API sends payloads with this structure:
        entry[0].changes[0].value.messages[0]

    This function safely navigates the nested structure and returns
    a flat dictionary with the relevant fields. If any level is missing,
    it returns safe defaults rather than crashing.

    Detects message types:
        - text: plain text message
        - image: image attachment
        - document: document attachment (PDF, etc.)
        - button: interactive button response (payload ID)

    Args:
        payload: The raw parsed JSON payload from Meta.

    Returns:
        A flat dictionary with keys:
            - has_message: bool — whether this payload contains a message
            - from_number: str — sender's WhatsApp number
            - message_id: str — Meta's message ID
            - type: str — message type (text/image/document/button)
            - text: str — message text (for text messages)
            - media_id: str — media ID (for image/document messages)
            - mime_type: str — MIME type (for image/document messages)
            - button_payload: str — button payload ID (for button messages)
