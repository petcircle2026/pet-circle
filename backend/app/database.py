"""
PetCircle Phase 1 — Database Connection

Establishes SQLAlchemy engine and session factory using DATABASE_URL
from environment configuration. All database access flows through
the get_db() dependency to ensure proper session lifecycle management.

Connection strategy:
    - Supabase uses PgBouncer/Supavisor (port 6543) in transaction mode.
    - QueuePool with pool_pre_ping=True validates each connection before
      use, but cannot prevent the TOCTOU race where SSL drops after ping.
    - pool_recycle=120 refreshes connections aggressively — well under any
      idle-timeout Supabase/Supavisor might enforce server-side.
    - Pool (pool_size=5, max_overflow=10) keeps fewer idle connections alive,
      reducing the target surface for server-side SSL termination while still
      supporting burst webhook + background task concurrency.
    - keepalives settings prevent OS-level TCP idle drops on long queries.

No business logic lives here — only connection infrastructure.
